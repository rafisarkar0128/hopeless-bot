## üöÄ Hopeless - A Discord Music Bot

**Hopeless Bot** is a discord bot, specially made for **Music Streaming**. It is built along with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js), a powerful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), and [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavalink), a powerful audio streaming server.

## üîß Requirements

Before you get started, you need to have the following:

- [![Node.JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Recommend LTS or Higher)
- [![Lavalink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lavalink-7289DA?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavalink) (V4 or Higher)
- [![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-47A248?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Required for MongoDB database)

## üöÄ Get Started

0. Install `pnpm` if you don't have it installed

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

1. First clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafisarkar0128/hopeless-bot.git
```

2. Change to the directory:

```bash
cd hopeless-bot
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pnpm install # you can also use npm if you want
```

4. Copy `example.lavalink-nodes.js` to `lavalink-nodes.js` and add your external nodes here if you are going to use any.

5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all the required values.

6. Now go to [Discord Developer Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) select your application and head to OAuth2 tab. In OAuth2 URL Generator select "bot" and "application.commands" scopes, scroll down select "Administrator" permission, copy the URL, open the URL and invite the bot to your server.

7. Start the bot:

```bash
# You can also use npm if you want
pnpm start
pnpm run dev # if you want to run in dev mode
```

8. Start using the bot. Use `/ping` or `/botinfo` commands.

### NOTE

By default, the bot doesn't load slash commands globally. To load slash commands globally, go to `.env`, change the value of `GLOBAL_COMMANDS` to `true`. This will make sure that the slash commands are available globally.

## üóùÔ∏è Sharding

**Sharding** is not recommended for bots that are in less than **2,000 servers**. By default the bot runs without sharding. To enable sharding, start the bot like this:

```bash
pnpm run shard
pnpm run devShard # if you want to run in dev mode
```

## üìú Commands

> There will be a dedicated markdown file for commands in future.
> For now here are some public commands of the bot.

| Name     | Description                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ping     | üèì Pong! Replies with bot's response time.      |
| botinfo  | üìñ View bot's information.                      |
| invite   | returns a link button with bot's invite URL.    |
